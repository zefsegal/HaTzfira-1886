# HaTzfira-1886
HaTzfira was founded and published in Warsaw in 1862 by Haim Zelig Slonimski, who also served as its editor. This weekly joined several other Hebrew periodicals published in the second half of the nineteenth century in Eastern Europe. Publication of HaTzfira ceased after six months and was re-established 12 years later, first in Berlin (because of governmental licensing issues that restricted publishing the periodical in Warsaw) and later in Warsaw. In 1886, the weekly transformed to a daily as part of a broader change in the Hebrew Journalistic world. 
In order to analyze the change, we initiated three different topic models on six years of the journalistic production (1883 - 1888), each designed to produce 20 topics and in which the units of analysis were individual issues of the journal. The first was conducted on the whole corpus (860 issues), thus enabling a detection of changes and patterns over the full period and a broader overview. The second and third models were conducted on sub-corpuses: 150 issues published 1883-1885, and 710 issues published 1886â€“1888 (see section VI).
